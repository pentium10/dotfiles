Getting Started
---------------
* `git clone git://github.com/pentium10/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles`
* `cd ~/.dotfiles`
* `make install` (or if you don't have `make`, then `./install`)

If you `clone` to a non-standard location a.k.a not `$HOME/.dotfiles` be sure
to edit `bash/bashrc.symlink` and update the `DOTFILES` variable.
